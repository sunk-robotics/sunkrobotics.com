      <p class="text-xl my-7">
        Sunk Robotics aims to create innovative engineering solutions in order to solve problems in ocean, seas, and lakes.
        Our work revolves around manufacturing Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) that compete in the Mate ROV Competition. 
        The competition simulates the process of performing tasks underwater. 
        These include repairing underwater fiber optic cables or making a 3d model coral bleaching. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl my-7">
        Sustainability and the environment are major themes of Sunk's projects. 
        When we design our robots, we make sure to keep in mind the environmental impact of the materials and processes involved.
